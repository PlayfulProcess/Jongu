# Interactive Collaborative Kids Books Project

## Project Vision

This project aims to transform static children's stories into an interactive, collaborative platform where users can:

- Rearrange pages through drag-and-drop functionality
- Upload new pages to existing stories
- Create entirely new stories
- Collaborate with others on story creation and modification

This exploration is part of my journey to learn AWS services while building something creative that connects with my interests in child development, creative expression, and therapeutic practices.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Components

- **Story Viewer**: Displays pages in a visually appealing, mobile-friendly format
- **Drag-and-Drop Interface**: Allows users to visually reorder pages 
- **Upload Interface**: Enables users to contribute new pages
- **Collaboration Tools**: Shows who contributed what and allows commenting

### Backend Architecture (AWS)

- **User Authentication** (AWS Cognito)
  - Secure user sign-up and login
  - User profiles and permissions

- **File Storage** (Amazon S3)
  - Storage for all page images
  - Version control of modified stories

- **Database** (Amazon DynamoDB)
  - Story metadata
  - Page ordering information
  - User contributions
  - Collaboration history

- **Application Logic** (AWS Lambda or AWS Elastic Beanstalk)
  - Process uploads
  - Handle page reordering
  - Manage version control
  - Facilitate real-time collaboration

- **API Layer** (Amazon API Gateway)
  - RESTful endpoints for frontend-to-backend communication

## Key Features

### Phase 1
- Basic user authentication
- Viewing existing stories
- Simple page reordering
- Image uploading for new pages

### Phase 2
- Advanced collaboration tools
- Commenting on pages
- Version history
- Creating entirely new stories

### Phase 3
- Public sharing options
- Featured community stories
- Potential integration with AI for story suggestions

## Technical Considerations

- **Image Processing**: Ensuring uploaded images are appropriately sized and formatted
- **Security**: Validating uploads, preventing malicious content
- **Performance**: Optimizing for quick loading even on slower connections
- **Mobile Experience**: Ensuring drag-and-drop works well on touch devices
- **Accessibility**: Making the interface usable for all abilities

## Learning Goals

- Understanding AWS service integration
- Managing cloud-based file storage with Amazon S3
- Implementing serverless functions with AWS Lambda
- Creating and managing NoSQL databases with DynamoDB
- Securing web applications with AWS Cognito
